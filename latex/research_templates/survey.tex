\subsubsection*{PI's relevant prior work}.
We have conducted a similar survey in a prior project to gather users' expectation of involving AI in their work \cite{xie2020chexplain}, which will inform the survey design and data analysis in this project. Specifically, in this prior work, as our first design iteration, we conducted a paired-survey on both referring physicians (N=39) and radiologists in (N=38) to learn about how radiologists currently explain their analysis to referring physicians and how referring physicians expect explanations from both human and (hypothetical) AI radiologists. The findings reveal whether, when, and what kinds of explanations are needed between referring physicians and radiologists, which analogously informs the design of explainable AI radiology.
