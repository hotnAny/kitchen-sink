\awardsummary.
\xac{update the macros of meta info in main.tex}

We seek this small amount of additional funding to provide an excellent research experience for undergraduates while developing new human-AI collaborative techniques for physicians.  
This REU supplement plays a critical role in our Broadening Participation in Computing program which uses undergraduate research experiences such as the ones proposed here to increase the percentage of undergraduate women who persist to graduate school.  
More generally, these research experiences are an important tool for recruitment of future graduate students into HCI research at the PI's institute.

In the Summary of Proposed Work, I have provided the following items:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Description of Research and Benefit to Student
    \item PI's Prior Experience Involving Undergraduates in Research
    \item Description of Mentoring for REU Students
    \item The Relationship of the Reu Funding to the Original Award
    \item Our Process and Criteria for Selecting Students
    \item A statement acknowledging that REU students will be US Citizens or Permanent Residents.
    \item Specifics about the REU Request
\end{enumerate}


These specific information items were requested in the Dear Colleague Letter NSF24-048 entitled ``Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) and Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) Supplemental Funding in Computer and Information Science and Engineering''.

The Budget Justification provides the program specifics including the duration, our stipend rate, and the description of the benefits of the UCLA Engineering Summer Undergraduate Research Program and the associated fee.

The NSF REU program is ideally suited for exposing undergraduate students to HCI research through this project.
The REU scope of work is well defined and the undergraduate student will have excellent mentors to help them learn research methodology and how to present their results. 
They will be exposed to forefront research and will have opportunities to present their findings in weekly meetings and at a research symposium.
