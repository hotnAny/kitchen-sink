\section*{Budget Justification}

The budget for this supplement has two entries.  The main expense is \$7,000 for stipends for each summer undergraduate researcher.
Each undergraduate researcher will be paid a stipend of \$7000 for a ten-week research project so that the stipend is \$700 per week, as recommended in the program solicitation NSF 23-601: Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU).

The second line item is for registration fees for the UCLA Summer Undergraduate Research Program (SURP).
SURP provides undergraduate researchers with training in the basic skills of research including how to present technical material to a variety of audiences, how to prepare a research abstract, how to read and discuss journal papers, and how to prepare and present an effective research poster.  The SURP culminates with a research symposium in which all participants will present posters on their research to faculty, corporate representatives, and fellow students.

The specific registration fees are \$500 for each student, which includes the Orientation, Poster Symposium, Poster Workshops, Technical Presentation Workshops, and Industry Engagement Workshops.
