\section*{A. SIGNIFICANCE}
% The Significance section should explain the importance of the problem or
% describe the critical barrier to progress in the field that is being addressed. Explain how
% the proposed research project will improve scientific knowledge, technical capability,
% and/or clinical practice in one or more broad fields. Describe how the concepts,
% methods, technologies, treatments, services, or preventative interventions that drive this
% field will be changed if the proposed aims are achieved.

% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

% - the importance of the problem;

% - the state of existing knowledge, including literature citations and highlights of relevant data;

% - explain gaps that the project is intended to fill; and

% - rationale of the proposed research;

% - potential contribution of this research to the scientific field(s) and public health.


\section*{B. INNOVATION}
% Explain how the application challenges and seeks to shift current research or
% clinical practice paradigms. Describe any novel theoretical concepts, approaches or
% methodologies, instrumentation or interventions to be developed or used, and any
% advantage over existing methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions. Explain any
% refinements, improvements, or new applications of theoretical concepts, approaches or
% methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions.

% points to hit:
% - Explain why concepts and methods are novel to the research field.
% - Focus on innovation in study design and outcomes.
% - Summarize novel findings to be presented as preliminary data in the Approach section.
